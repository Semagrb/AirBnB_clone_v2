# ðŸŒ¸ HBNB - The Console ðŸŒ¸

This repository sparkles with the beginnings of a student project, a charming endeavor to create a magical clone of the AirBnB website. Our journey starts with the creation of a backend interface, a console, to manage the enchanting world of program data. With the console commands, users can effortlessly create, update, and destroy objects, all while managing the mystical realm of file storage. Thanks to the magic of JSON serialization/deserialization, the storage is persistent, ensuring the magic lingers between sessions.

1. First, clone this repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned, locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:

/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py

4. When this command is run, the following prompt should appear:

(hbnb)

5. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands
 * create - Creates an instance based on the given class
 * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID
 * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID
 * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class
 * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID
 * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)

##### Alternative Syntax
Users can issue a number of console commands using an alternative syntax:

 Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

 * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class
 * count - Returns the number of object instances by class
 * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID
 * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID
 * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID
